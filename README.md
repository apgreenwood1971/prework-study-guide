# Skills Bootcamp Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was developed to help keep track of the subjects covered while working through the Bootcamp pre-work. I wanted one place where information could be found about HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.

This proved challenging due to my lack of knowledge with Git and JavaScript.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

There are four sections called HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript and each contacins notes on that topic.

If you access the Chrome DevTools by pressing either Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) and a new window will open to the side or below.
